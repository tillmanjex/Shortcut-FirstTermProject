# "Shortcut" - First Term Project WS2122 - TJ Schaeuble

## Introduction
Virtual reality provides an opportunity to experience digital artworks in new ways. But the VR environment in this sense should not mimic the paradigms of art consumption we know and trust by rebuilding art galleries and viewing cinemas as we know them. We should be more imaginative. "Shortcut" is an exploration of this new opportunity. It offers a space between reality and dreamscape, where curiosity and surrealism are integrated into the act of viewing graphical artworks and listening to music.

## Navigation
This repository includes:
- Documentation of Processing sketch designs
- Documentation of Unity development
- Development log of Unity development
- Supporting imagery and gifs for documentation

The Unity project can be found in this repository [here](UNITY/) as an exported package. You will be able to import this into a new 3D unity scene, navigate around and assess scripts, setups and content. Running the scene in VR requires additional packages and setup. For this, I have uploaded the full project folder here and is also a more suitable option if you would simply like to download or view the project file structures and content.    
Note: The project is however configured for use with a HP Reverb G2 (ie, windows mixed reality setup). I have not been able to test with another headset to see if it works out of the box.
