# Shortcut - Wrapup

## Thoughts on Process

My idea stayed fundamentally unchanged from the original pitch during the application process. 
What did change was that the interactive liquid mirror was not included. I identified early on that this was going to prove such a considerable technical challenge, that I may have risked spending too much time implementing it, and be left with little time to design and build the VR environment itself. Even if the liquid mirror interaction ended up working nicely, to have the VR environment uninspiring and non-immersive would have detracted too much from the mirror interaction itself, and this for me was not worth it, as the main goal for me was to test my creative ideas in new ways and with new mediums - and not to present a technical challenge met with success.

I therefore replaced the mirror interaction with the creation and presentation of generative Processing sketches within the VR world. I'm quite happy to have thought to do this, as it also created a space for me to consider another use of VR as a medium to experience digital art in ways that augment the artworks themselves. 

This therefore remained inline with my general direction of thought, which is that when the paradigms and regular structures of reality are removed from view, we are invited to experience and enjoy more openly. I often find this is how dreams feel, and therefore wanted to try and emulate this entire concept and feeling within this project - while simultaneously learning to use new mediums and technology, namely VR, Unity, generative code and Processing.
